Arrange, add or remove items within/to/from/ the layout with "Drag &amp; Drop": Click on a page element, hold the mouse button pressed and 
move the mouse. "Drop" the element by releasing the mouse button. The elements are positioned "relative", this means they snap into their place instead of staying 
exactly where you left them.
<ul>
<li>Remove page elements by dragging them from one of the 4 drop areas in the layout into the '<strong>Available D&amp;D items</strong>' box on the right </li>
<li>Add page elements by dragging them from the '<strong>Available D&amp;D items</strong>' box on the right into one of the 4 drop areas in the layout.</li>
<li>You can also move page elements within each drop area or between 2 drop areas.</li>
</ul>
4 "drop areas" (See <span style="color:green">green areas in the image</span> on the right) are available in the layout:
<ol>
<li>Whole Header area</li>
<li>Top of center column (Above first post)</li>
<li>Bottom of center column (After last post)</li>
<li>Whole Footer area</li>
</ol>
<strong>Note:</strong> You cannot drop items into the sidebars, or in between posts.<br /><br />
After you changed the location of Drag &amp; Drop items, click the '<strong>Save D&amp;D</strong>' button on the top right.
<br /><br />
<strong>If you cannot drop an item</strong> into a certain drop area (such as the footer), then that drop area 
probably (1) is empty <strong> and</strong> (2) has no padding either, which means it occupies no space at all in the layout. Due to this you cannot 
point your mouse pointer "into" the area to be able to drop the item there. Click the '<strong>Highlight Drop Areas</strong>' on the top right to temporarily 
highlight and "blow up" (add padding) to all 4 drop areas. After you aranged the drop items click the button again to remove the highlighting.
