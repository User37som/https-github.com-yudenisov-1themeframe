<li>"Sidebars" are the columns on the left and right hand side of the layout.</li>
<li>Each page template can have its own sidebar setup, with up to 3 sidebars on the left and 3 on the right 
(The setting "3" means 1 wide sidebar on top followed by 2 narrow sidebars below).</li>
<li>Each sidebar is a "widget area". In WordPress, the term "widget" is used for containers with some content (i.e. an ad, a list of recent posts, a search form...). 
Inside the WP admin area the available widgets can be placed inside the available widget areas. The available widgets are 
provided by WP, the theme &amp; plugins. The available widget areas are provided by the theme. TF themes have at least 6 widget areas (each sidebar is one).
