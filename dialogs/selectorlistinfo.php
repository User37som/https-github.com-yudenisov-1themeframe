Some elements here on the Live Preview cannot be accessed with the mouse pointer because they are "hidden" behind another element. <br/><br/>
There is no margin or padding between/inside two elements, so there's no place where you could point at with the 
mouse pointer, to select the element. <br/><br/>Select those impossible-to-grab elements manually, from the "CSS Selectors" list on the top right.
