<ul>
<li>When you move your mouse ("hover") over the live preview area, you'll notice that the page element under your mouse pointer gets 
highlighted: Semi-transparent boxes are put behind and above the element to visualize its dimensions and, if any, its margin ("outer space"), its 
padding ("inner space") and its borders.</li>
<li>When you <strong>Right-Click</strong> on an element, a little window pops ups. In this window you can adjust the CSS of the element by 
picking colors, selecting options and adjusting sizes with a slider.</li>
<li>While you edit the settings in that pop-up CSS form, you can view the changes being applied to the live preview in real-time</li>
<li>What you see is just a "this is what it would look like if you changed the CSS like that" kind of preview "faked" by Javascript.</li>
<li>To apply the settings for real, click the "Save" button on the top right of the little CSS popup window.</li>
<li>Usual CSS parent->child inheritance applies and may sometimes lead to unexpected results in the Live Preview. If you edit one setting that single setting will 
be adjusted here in the live preview - it won't re-render the whole page. Click the current page template's menu button on the left 
(i.e. "index.php") again to reload the live preview, for an accurate preview. </li>
